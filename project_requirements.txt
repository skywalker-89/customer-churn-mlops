Project: [01276343] ML Project for Case Analysis (Numerical Forecasting & Categorical Prediction)Grouping: 3 ppl. maxDocument submitted: Report, slides & presentation, ipynb notebook and/or python script, and another related doc (if any)Type of presentation: On-site (During class hours)Dates:February 9, 2026: Data selection and problem setting; Presentation only.March 9, 2026: Final presentation; All documents are required to be submitted.Task DescriptionSelect a dataset to use for analysis, gaining insights, solving problems, and making predictions from the data source. (You are allowed to change the dataset, but only once before Deadline: February 9, 2026)Set up your team’s project problem and current state from the assigned dataset.Study and describe the purpose of using data or feature attributes (storytelling and feature insight).Remark: Consider using 5 or more feature attributes to solve the project problem (if less than 5 features, provide a basic explanation to me first).Hint: Check the importance of a feature variable (Feature importance) LinkModel implementation details: Build model, set up training-testing iterations, & batch runs, and save-load model to test data follows your data in hands.Note: You are allowed to use libraries, but they must also include functions built from scratch.A. Numerical forecasting or estimation (regression analysis):Linear regressionMultiple regressionPolynomial regressionA better classification model (mandatory)B. Categorical prediction (classification task):Logistic regressionDecision treeEnsemble learning: Random ForestSupport vector machineDimensionality reduction for random forest/support vector machineUnsupervised k-mean and agglomerative clusteringPerceptron & Single-layer perceptron (SLP)Multi-layer perceptron (MLP)A better classification model (mandatory)Requirements for Models & Results:New Model: Use at least one new model outside of classroom learning, including building from scratch and ready-to-use functions. This has a positive or equivalent effect on learning from previously learned models. It is used in both linear regression estimation and classification tasks.Quantitative results, benchmarking, analysis, and discussion:Data analysis (if any)LossConfusion matrixAccuracyPrecision, Sensitivity, Specificity, True Negative Rate, F1-scoreROC & AUCPerformance curve (e.g., accuracy plot, loss plot, etc.)R-Square (For regression analysis)Others (if any)Propose Datasets DetailNote: Don’t use the same dataset as the group that proposed it earlier, first come first serve :PFinancial-related datasetsInvestment-related datasetsFraud/counterfeit detection datasetsCustomer/commercial/industrial analysis-related datasetsChannel to enter group member details and the dataset to be used:TBA in Google Classroom with accessible google sheet.Scoring CriteriaCriteriaScoreRemark1. Project Setup & Analysis• Finalize the problem setting of the project.• Finalize feature selection and insight (why must use ML/DL tools)?• Case analysis and preparation of structured data.30Presentation Dates:1st round: 9/2/2026• Data insights (Presentation only)2nd round: 9/3/2026• Report• Slide & Presentation• Python notebook (.ipynb) and/or Python script (.py)• Other related documents (if any)• Demo (if any)2. Model and Implementation Details• Task: Regression (all models are built from scratch)• Task: Classification (all models are built from scratch)• A better regression model (mandatory and built from scratch)• A better classification model (mandatory and built from scratch)40Every model must be built from scratch, but allowing to use both function from scratch and ready-to-use function (Scikit-learn/PyTorch) to confirm results.3. Evaluation Scoring(Accuracy, loss, F1, performance curve, etc.)30Extra Points1. Setting your team project problem, storytelling, and data preparation solution for the selected dataset are highly creative.2. Your model has much better performance than existing-taught models in on the above list.
